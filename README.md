# Welcome to BloatWars

Northcoders is going open source. We feel its time to jump on the bandwagon in order to improve our reputation in the dev community. All the cool companies are doing it! However, we don't want to make it too easy for our rivals to steal our code, so we're enlisting you to help **bloat-ify** our code base. We need _you_ to take those slick, wonderfully efficient and readable katas you've been writing and tone down those best practices just a touch...

In this repo we have provided you with a kata you may remember from your first week on the course. We want you to rewrite your solution in the most round-a-bout, convoluted, and impossibly obscure manner you can. As long as it passes the tests, you can make it do anything you want. Bonus points will be awarded if I can fry an egg on my CPU whilst running your code.
